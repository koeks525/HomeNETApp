    <string name="what_is_homent_string">HomeNET is a social networking mobile app, built for the android platform. This application has many features, that may be deemed as advanced for users who are new to social networking, or users who are new to a social network of this nature. The purpose of this document is to provide clear, concise guidance to a user who may want information around using the mobile application. This document has been written in such a way that a user with little or no technical background can comprehend.  The system consists of an Android application, as well as a Web API. Users of the system should only concern themselves with the mobile application. The Web API is for developers – people who may want to build applications that need some HomeNET element to it.</string>
    <string name="how_homenet_works_string">HomeNET defines your “social groups” as Houses. Anyone who has an active HomeNET account can create a house. Once the house is created, users can join the house. When a user posts content (a post or a photo), they have the choice of choosing which audience they want to address (in this case, choosing the house they want to share the content with). Only users subscribed to a specific house can view content shared by other users who are subscribed to the same house. These social circles aim to create a social network that is more “personal”. Users can view basic details pertaining to the house(s) they are subscribed to. Only the house administrator (the user that created the house) can modify details to the house.</string>
    <string name="how_to_join_house">To join a house, open your navigation menu. From the menu, select the \"Join House\" option. This will take to you a new screen where you can specify the name of the house you wish to join (this can be done by inputting the name of the house, or searching by voice). The system will search for houses that match your crieria. Once you see a suitable result, select the 3-dotted button and select \"Join House\". This will send a request to the house administrator about you joining the house.</string>
    <string name="how_to_create_house_string">To create a house, open your navigation menu. On the menu, select the \"Create House\" option. This will open a screen where you can specify details for your new house. Note that a profile picture is mandatory. Once you are done specifying details to your house, select the create house button - this will create your house. Once that is done, you are now a house administrator. People who wish to join your house must get approval from you.</string>
    <string name="using_homenet_general_string">Once you are subscribed to at least one house, the mobile application will redirect you to your news feed. The news feed contains posts made by other members in the house(s) you are subscribed to. In this feed, you have the choice of liking the post, or disliking the post. Other parts of the application you can navigate to include Announcements, Settings and Messages. Announcements are messages which are broadcast to every member in a subscribed house, and messages are private messages sent to a specific member of a house.</string>
    <string name="creating_new_post_string">To create a new post, select the new post (+ floating button) from your news feed. This will open a new screen where you specify details to your new post. When creating a new post, you have the choice of specifying just the post text or specifying text and a photo – if you wish to upload a photo. Should you be subscribed to many house, please be sure to select the appropriate house from the spinner. If you would like to share your post onto external social media sites, you can select the appropriate options. Once you are happy with every detail, select the orange floating button to create the post. Every member in the house is notified of your new post.</string>
    <string name="viewing_post_metrics_string">Users of HomeNET can view additional information on a post, such as the total likes, dislikes and the users who liked/disliked a post. Do get to this dialog, a user must select the 3-dotted menu button and then select “View Details” from the pop up menu.</string>
    <string name="viewing_comments_string">To view comments made on a specific post, tap on the related post. This will take you to a screen where you can view the original post, post metrics, and comments made by other users on that post. To add your own comment, simply type in the text area provided at the bottom of the screen. Once you are done, click the floating button with the send icon. This will add the comment to the post and update system metrics. </string>
    <string name="creating_announcements_string">An announcement is defined as a broadcast message that is sent to all members of a house. These are useful when you need to send something out to everybody. To view announcements for all houses you are subscribed to, select the Announcements tab from the bottom bar. To create a new announcement, select the + sign. For an announcement to be valid, you must send a valid title and description. Once the announcement has been saved, all users subscribed to the house you are addressing will get notification that a new announcement has been created.</string>
    <string name="creating_messages_string">HomeNET allows for private messaging amongst members in the same house. To view messages, select the “Messages” tab, from the bottom bar. This will pull up a list of messages that have been sent to you, or messages you have sent to other people in the subscribed house. To create a new message, select the + floating button. When creating a new message, you need to specify basic details to the message (title and description). If you are subscribed to multiple houses, you will need to select the house you wishing to address. Once you have selected an appropriate house, users in that house will be loaded onto the dropdown list. Select the user you wishing to send the message to, and press the send button when you are done.</string>
    <string name="photo_gallery_string">To view photos uploaded by users who are subscribed to houses you are subscribed to, select the photo’s tab on the bottom navigation bar. This will pull up a list of all photos posted by users. Please note that this task can take long, depending on your internet connection and the number of images posted by users. To view basic post information relating to a photo (who posted it, together with post text), select the appropriate image.</string>
    <string name="photo_joined_houses_string">My Houses is a feature where subscribers of a house can view a top-level report on how the house is doing. Here, a user can view total posts, announcements, comments, members, and so forth. To view this report, open the navigation menu and select “My Houses”. This will pull up a screen where you can see latest stats on the subscribed house. If you have multiple houses, use the drop down at the top of the screen to refresh the screen with appropriate house metrics. Users also have the option of leaving the house, should they want to end their relationship with the selected house.</string>
    <string name="how_to_manage_house_string">NOTE: Only house administrators (owners) are able to manage their house(s). The house manager allows house administrators the ability of managing various aspects to their house (manage users, posts, details about the house, etc.). To start managing the house, open your navigation menu and select House Manager (note that an ownership check is performed).</string>
